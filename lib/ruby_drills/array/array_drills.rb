Ruby Drills: Arrays and Enumerable

Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.

Arrays are Enumerable. The Enumerable mixin provides collection
classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort.
In this drill, you'll practice the methods in the Enumerable mixin that relate to
Arrays.
