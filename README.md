# Ruby Drills

Drills are a way to practice a langauge feature for mastery. Challenges in Ruby Drills are focused on a specific method. Answers typically consist of a single line.

For example, a drill for the `Enumerable#zip` method could consist of the following:

Your objective is to complete the drill with ease and joy, without consulting any external documentation.

Drills are used in sports to master specific movements. In basketball, players drill on free throws, three-pointers, and dribbling. Scrimmages, on the other hand, are used to mimic the conditions and complexity of a game in order to integrate skills built in drills and develop teamwork.

In programming, drills are useful for developing skills in specific language features, API's, or idioms. Drills lack the complexity of a full project. They can be performed alone or with others. Drills complement more complex scrimmage practices such as Ruby Koans, Ruby Quiz, or work on an open-source project.

## Installation

Ruby Drills are meant to be used as a standalone tool.

    $ gem install ruby_drills

And then execute:

    $ ruby_drills

## Usage

Drills run in the command line. You answer questions in drills using a REPL. This practice has the benefit of preparing you for developing at the REPL, a useful technique for trying out langauge features or algorithms.
Start by choosing an available drill from the menu.

    Arrays
    Hashes
    Enumerable

The drills will then walk you through one-line challeges that will allow you to demonstrate your mastery of the API.
